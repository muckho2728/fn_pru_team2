🎮 Five Nights at Freddy’s: Rebuilt – Fear Reimagined 👾

👻 About the Game



Welcome to Five Nights at Freddy’s: Rebuilt, a student re-creation project developed by FPT University students as part of the PRU (Production Unit) course.

This project aims to rebuild the classic horror experience of Five Nights at Freddy’s (FNAF) using Unity and C#, while introducing modern gameplay improvements, optimized performance, and enhanced visual fidelity.



Players take the role of a night security guard working at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, tasked with surviving against haunted animatronics that come to life after midnight.

Monitor cameras, conserve power, and stay alive — if you can.
